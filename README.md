## Development

Contributors should push to their own branch. Reviewed code will be merged to `master` branch.

Currently this project assumes Go >= 1.23.

1. set your `GOPATH` to a directory: `export GOPATH=/home/go`. Set `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`: `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
2. `go get github.com/sjtug/lug`
3. Install dep by `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh`
3. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sjtug/lug && dep ensure`
4. Modify code, then use `go build .` to build binary, or test with `go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)`
5. Run `scripts/gen_license.sh` before committing your code
